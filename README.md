# RevBoost ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ

## Inspiration
While working as a Data Engineering Intern at TD Bank, I had the opportunity to explore customer analytics across various platforms involving recurring services and usage-based patterns. I noticed how small shifts in engagement or service combinations could indicate broader behavioral trends â€” often overlooked until too late. This sparked the idea for RevBoost: a tool that combines predictive analytics with AI-generated strategies to help businesses better understand customer segments and proactively tailor their offerings. RevBoost reflects my drive to translate raw data into meaningful, actionable insights that bridge technical depth with business value.

## What It Does
RevBoost is a customer intelligence dashboard that predicts churn, segments customer behavior, and generates actionable retention strategies using AI. Business teams can interactively explore which customers are most at risk, understand behavioral clusters, and receive GPT-powered recommendations to drive engagement and revenue.

## Core Features
Customer Segmentation (K-Means): Automatically clusters customers based on tenure, spend, service use, and more.

Churn Prediction (Logistic Regression): Calculates churn probabilities and assigns a risk level: Low, Medium, or High.

LLM-Driven Strategy Generator: GPT-4o creates personalized or segment-based retention strategies.

Streamlit Dashboard: Interactive interface to explore insights and generate customer or segment-level action plans.

Risk Scoring & Explanation: Each customer gets a churn probability + risk level, with interpretable attributes.
